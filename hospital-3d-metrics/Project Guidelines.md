- build interactive visualizations that display metrics overlaid on the shape of my hospital, by floor and unit, preferably a 3d representation of the hospital. The idea is to create visually striking interactive cross-departmental dashboards and also have the ability to see how those specific data elements of interest are distributed throughout the hospital at a high level. So not only would any specific hospital unit be able to see their own metrics (patient satisfaction, patient acuity, current patient fall risk, socioeconomic diversity of patients, staff retention rates, and past metric such as # of falls, # of infections, etc, ) but also see how their metrics compare across the hospital.

- I could do approximately my proof of concept on two rectangle-like-cube objects, one representing the East Building and the other representing the West Building. For the West building, there are 4 floors named 1 West, 2 West, 3 West, and 4 West. For the East Building there are three floors named 1 East, 2 East, and 3 East.

- I would want to start with real data feeding the interactive elements, but it can be as simple as a .csv with floor identifiers to start. I think that the Base Geometry idea you gave is a perfect start and want the Simple interactivity for clicking and hovering over a floor, the ability to click, highlight and have additional information come up, color scale heatmap-like effect directly on the floors, filters and sliders to change the static data, in the data file, displayed in an interactive and real-time manner. 

- create this proof of concept using a hybrid approach using Python for data management and a JavaScript/WebGL framework like Three.js for the frontend visualization

Key Requirements:

1. 3D visualization of two buildings (East & West) with their respective floors
2. Interactive elements (hover, click) for exploring metrics
3. Heat map visualization capabilities
4. Real-time metric updates based on filters/sliders
5. Data comparison features across units
6. Python backend for data management
7. Three.js frontend for 3D visualization


1. Frontend (Three.js + React):
* 3D building models with interactive floor segments
* React components for UI controls and metric displays
* Material system for heat map visualization
* Event handling for hover/click interactions


2. Backend (Python + FastAPI):
* Data management and processing
* API endpoints for metric queries
* CSV data parsing and serving:

## Visualization Features:
* users be able to rotate/zoom the 3D view?
* include the ability to "explode" the view to see all floors simultaneously?
* include a 2D floor plan view option as well?
